# Welcome to Fusion!

This repository contains all of the code necessary to complete each of the steps in the Arc PageBuilder Fusion training curriculum.

## How to use

This repo contains one branch for each of the labs in the Fusion training curriculum. Each branch builds off of the previous completed lab so you can check your solutions as you go. For example, to see the solution to lab 4, you can switch to lab-05 branch since thats where lab 5 starts off.

It's important to note that the code in this repo may differ from the code written on-the-spot in your training session. However, the files will contain the same information and represent a complete version of each concept.

## Getting started

1. Create a new directory for your project called FusionFeatureStories
```
mkdir FusionFeatureStories
```

2. Change into the directory:
```
cd FusionFeatureStories
```

3. Install the Fusion CLI
```
npm i @arc-fusion/cli
```

4. Initialize a new Fusion feature pack
```
npx fusion init
```

5. Change the origin to point to the Fusion-Training-User-Stories repo (in a real scenario, `Fusion-Training-User-Stories` would be replaced by the repo name of your new project)
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories.git
```

6. Check out a new branch called USERNAME-fusion-training where USERNAME is your username. 
```
git checkout -b USERNAME-fusion-training
```

NOTE: This is the branch you will make all your changes to while going through this training.

## Useful Commands 

```
npx fusion rebuild
```
- This forces a webpack rebuild of a running cluster. [Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arc-fusion/cli#rebuild)
- Use this command if enviornment variables are not picked up by rebuild or if you need to restart the webpack container.
