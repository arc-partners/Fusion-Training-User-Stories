# Welcome to Arc Outbound Feeds!

This repository contains all of the code necessary to complete each of the steps in the Arc Outbound Feeds training curriculum.

## Overview
Since Arc’s inception, all feeds for Arc customers have been custom built and necessitated coordination with Arc’s Professional Services and Client Support teams to make any updates to those custom feeds. Customers have not had the ability to add or modify their feeds directly. Arc Outbound Feeds is the first product offering that will start to shift more control over feeds directly to you. More generally, Arc Outbound Feeds will include:

- Self-service management and configuration of Arc Outbound Feeds
- Arc maintenance and support of Arc Outbound Feeds along with product upgrades over time
- Ability to create and manage your own custom feeds leveraging Arc’s development platform, PageBuilder Engine

## How to use

This repo contains one branch for each of the labs in the Arc Outbound Feeds training curriculum. Each branch builds off of the previous completed lab so you can check your solutions as you go. For example, to see the solution to obf (outbound feeds) lab 4, you can switch to obf-lab-05 branch since thats where obf lab 5 starts off.

It's important to note that the code in this repo may differ from the code written on-the-spot in your training session. However, the files will contain the same information and represent a complete version of each concept.
