# Lab 15
On this branch, we have are now utilizing site properties so that we can render site specific properties within an organization.

It's time to learn how to work with multiple output types. As we have learned, output types allow fusion to render content in different formats and for different purposes (AMP, JSON, XML, etc).

1. In the `components/output-types` directory, create an amp.jsx file

2. Within the react component return the entire page content (from the html tag to the body tag), while rendering the children from props. Remember to add in any AMP support tags needed. Refer to the [AMP documentation](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/spec/amphtml/) for further details.

3. There are other attributes in props we can use to render content. For example, the favicon can be displayed by:

```
<link rel='icon' type='image/x-icon' href={deployment(`${contextPath}/resources/favicon.ico`)} />
```
where `deployment` and `contextPath` are extracted from props

4. `CssLinks`, `MetaTags` and `Libs` components can be extracted from the props and rendered in the head tag. e.g. `<CssLinks />`

5. Similarily, `Fusion` components should be extracted from props and rendered in the body - `<Fusion />`. This [bootstraps data from the server that will hydrate our React components](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/creating-using-output-types.md).

6. Now lets render an AMP version of our color-block component. In the color-block directory, create an amp.jsx file. When the AMP output type loads, it automatiacally looks for the `amp.jsx` version of all the features isntead of the `default.jsx`.

7. In this case, we only need to return the elements of the feature we want to render from the component. Add a React component here that renders the color the way you want it to on AMP pages.

8. After fusion rebuild, load your amp page by adding the following query at the end of your test page url `?outputType=amp` and confirm you can see your AMP page.
